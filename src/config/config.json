To summarize, it is an Instance Segmentation task with high class imbalance.\n•After implementing baseline state-of-art algorithms (Mask RCNN, Spacenet), the performance was improved by approaching the labelling problem as a comparative task instead of classification and utilizing Siamese networks. A mask RCNN based on a 6-channel input image was also implemented.",
